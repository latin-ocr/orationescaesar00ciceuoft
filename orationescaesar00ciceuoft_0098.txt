PRO REGE DEIOTARO ORATIO.

Rome (5 41, the same three envoys, with Dorylaus): hoping to
recover from him his forfeited provinces. When young Castor
conceived the idea of tampering with the loyalty of the physician
Phidippus who was attached to the second embassy, and ruining his
grandfather by an accusation, he doubtless held a brief for the
aggrieved family of the Galatian tyrant. The Dictator sat in his
own house to try the case in virtue of the revived regal prerogative.
Cicero undertook the defence of his old friend and ally.

ξ 6. He addresses himself in his defence to two main contentions:
first, that the charge of attempted poisoning is a clumsy slander
based on the evidence of a worthless slave: second,⁴ that the king
had not harboured snllen and vindictive feelings against Caesar. It
is in the latter, the more delicate part of his task, that the orator's
tact appears to fullest advantage.

Nothing certain is known about Caesar's verdict: but it seems at
least highly probable that he deferred his decision until his proposed
expedition against Parthia in the year following. The dagger of
Brutus proved more effective than the eloquence of Cicero. On the
news of Caesar's assassination, Deiot. immediately recovered Lesser
Armenia by force of arms: his envoys at Rome meanwhile, by a
bribe of 10 millions of sesterces to Fulvia, procured from Antonius a
forged order in Caesar's name, that the king was to be reinstated in
his lost possessions ¹.

NOTES.

cum in omnibus causis . . . tum in hae, ete„ ‘ in all import-
ant cases. . . but in this case especially': the individual thing is
picked out sor contrast with the other members of its class. Some-
times (as here) the cum takes subj. owing to a slightly concessive
force, ‘whereas,' ‘although.' But Mur. § 56 has quae cum sunt
gravia, tum illud acerbissimum est. Cp. ξ 12 infra.

Cicero’s nervousness was not assumed for effect. He refers to it
in Cluent. ξ 51, semper equidem magno cum metu incipio dicere;
and notes it as a mark os the best orator, de Or. i. 5 120 ut quisque
optime dicit ita maxime dicendi difficultatem variosque eventus
