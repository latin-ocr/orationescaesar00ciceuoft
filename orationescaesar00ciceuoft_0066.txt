PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO.

in turn to thank the Dictator for his clemency. Cicero, who felt
himself now shorn of his former greatness‚ had resolved never to
speak again in the House. But ‘on this glorious day’ he was
carried away by the magnanimity of the Dictator and the hopes of a
restored republic which it inspired; he returned thanks, as he says,
‘at some length’ ( pluribus verbz·s); and his eloquent utterance is
preserved to us, as we believe, in the Marcelliana.

ξ 4. Fate withheld what Caesar had so generously granted. M.
Marcellus, whose acknowledgment of Cicero's services is extant
(ad Fam. iv. 11), slowly and almost reluctantly set out for Rome.
At Piraeus, on May 23, B.C. 45, he met his colleague of Rc. 51,
Ser. Sulpicius, then proconsul of Achaia. He had once been warned
by Cicero of the ‘ license of the sword, in foreign parts more active
and more unabashed’1: and with only too much reason. Two
days after his meeting with Sulpicius, he fell a victim to the knife of
an assassin, one P. Magius Chilo, of his own suite, whose motive is
unknown. The news was carried to his old colleague, who hastened
to the place, only to find him some hours dead, but had his body
burnt with all honour in the Academy, and charged the Athenians
with the erection os a marble tomb to his memory. ‘ Ita vir clarissi-
mus ab homine deterrimo acerbissima morte est adfectus, et cui
inimici propter dignitatem pepercerant, inventus est amicus, qui ei
mortem offerret ' (ad Fam. iv. 12, 2).

NOTES.

Pro M. Marcello Oratio: the speech is not a defence but a
panegyric. Cic. himself might have entitled it ‘de M. Marcello
restituto gratiae C. Caesari actae.' Writing to Ser. Sulpicius he
says of it, ‘ pluribus verbis egi Caesari gratias ' (ad Fam. iv. 4. 4).

The pluperf. refers the action to a further past ; it is over and done
with. Cp. Ligar. ξ 1 paratus veneram.
