PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO.

questions being suppressed. ‘ Am Ι right in saying it was of neees-
sity‚or . . .?’

incredibilem quendam, ‘ quite inconceivable’ ε hic, adverb.

euius ego: Cicero is fond of bringing pronouns into juxta- -
position; so infra, tuae mihi apud te3 ξ 33 ipsum te cuius id eum‘.
For fide cp. note on Deiot. ξ 1.

defendit, pregnant use, defendendi causa dicit‘ says in desence’
cp. turbam (turbando facere) bellum, ex,cusare contendo (contenta
voce dieere),‘ raise my voice)

in ea voluntate, not: in ea parte ξ 2 (as Halm). Ligarius
belonged to the same party as Cicero and Tubero, not however of
his own choice but by the force of circumstances.

tacitam, ‘ unexpressed ’ ε so tacita opinio, t. exspectatio.

quanta lux . . . oboriatur = ‘how bright is the dawning of
my hopes as I plead at the tribunal osone so generous and wise as
you are.' Lux and spes are osten connected: Verg. A. ii. 281 O
lux Dardaniae, spes o fidissima Teucrum. For sapientiae v. Marc.
5 1 n.

contendam, v. n. on alflndz'l supra.

exaudiat, ‘hear clearly ’ every syllable ¹.

gesto etiam ex parte magna : the war began in January, B.C. 49,
Cicero joined Pompeius in June, by which time Caesar was master
os Italy. Quintilian has observed that the orator here disguises
flattery under an air of extreme outspokenness (παρρησία).

ad me ex Aegypto litteras misit : after Pharsalus Cicero retired
to Brundisium, waited there in uncertainty as to Caesar's intentioris
towards himself (November, B.C. 48, to September, B.C. 47); about
June he received from him a letter which did not satisfy him (exigue
scripta ad Att. xi. 16), but in August another (satis liberales, ad Fam.
xiv. 23, letter to his wife) to which he probably here· refers; and in
September, when Caesar lauded, he waited on him and was well
received.

oum ipse . . . passus est3 as proconsul of Cilicia, Cicero
gained some successes over the tribes of Mount Amanus, and was
saluted imperator by his troops. For this reason, after his return,
January 4, B.C. 49, he retained the laureate fasces and abstained
from entering the city, hoping for the triumph which never came,
until B.C. 47 (cp. Deiot. ξ 11). Caesar received the title of im-
perator for life (perpetuus) in B.C. 463 but he was allowed to use it
as a praenomen, and so the Emperors subsequently.
