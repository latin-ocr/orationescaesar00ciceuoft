and with this may be connected the circumstance that he so osten
played a desperate game with destiny ’ (Mommsen l.c.).

quantumcumque est, ‘whatever it amounts to,' is ambiguous, ξ 7,
often implying a small amount; hence the next words, ‘ and it does
amount to something very considerable.' Contrast the sense in
Verg. Aen. i. 78 tu mihi quodcumque hoc regni . . concilias, ‘this
little kingdom.’

inquam, generally inserted when the same word (or idea) is re-
iterated: cp. infra§ 28; Lig. § 15 quam tu per te, per te, inquam
obtines3 Deiot. § 8.

istius gloriae, viz. ‘which you have just won by your act of
magnanimity': n. on Lig. ξ, 10.

tuam esse, sc. istam gloriam. ‘That the praise of it is wholly
and inalienably yours.’

numquam temeritas . . commiscetur, neque . . admittitur;
there is a parallelism of meaning between the clauses. ‘ For venture-
someness will never blend with prudence : and hazard does not enter
into a wisely-laid plan.’

inmanitate barbaras instead of inm. barbara to preserve the ξ 8.
symmetry of the phrases. Inmunis (in-, manus) from meaning
‘ unmanageable ’ comes to mean ‘ savage ’ ‘ barbarous ' : as the old
word manus (whence ‘Manes' good spirits) meant ⁴good'; cp.
χειροήθης, mansuetus, εὐχερής. So Lig. ξ 11 inmanes barbari. Of
things, ‘ inhuman,’ versus; Deiot. ξ 25, cp. ib. ᾗ 32¹..

copiarum, ‘ resources ’ ; so Deiot. ξ 14.

condicio (from condico, ‘ stipulate’) (a) ‘terms offered' as in
Deiot. ξ 11: (h) ‘ conditions’ in a logical sense: the fact or facts
which are involved in anything and must be accepted with it, Marc.
ξ 12 ipsius victoriae c.: (c) hence ‘position‘ or ‘situation,' never
quite ‘state‘ : regia c. Deiot. § 3: (d) ‘constitution,’ coupled with
natura and almost its equivalent here. The sentence implies, strictly
speaking, that in conquering himself Caesar won a victory which in
the natural order of things is impossible3 it is skilsully turned by
the conclusion that Caesar is simillimus deo ε although we may think
such language tasteless exaggeration.

victoriae, most MSS. —am : ‘to be moderate in the use of a vic-
tory ' : the dat. is read on the authority of the gramman'an Arusianus
Messius, who says ‘temperat huic, Cicero de M. Marcello.' Tem-
pero and moderor with the dat. mean ‘to' restrain,’ with the accus
‘to govern.' [But two MSS. give victum, and AH victo, the latter
perhaps right according to Miiller and Mr. Clark]
