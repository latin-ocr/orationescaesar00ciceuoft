NOTES: CHAP. [J. ᾗ 5-1V. ᾗ 10.

tum denique . . . reddere, si . . . dedisset: or. recta, tum
denique reddo si dedi.

vide, sq„ apostrophe: n. on ξ 2. ut introd. dependent question. ξ 8.

qui . . . non dubitem, subj. of contrast aster the relative (qui
=quarnvis), as osten, but not invariably : the tendency to assimila-
tion os mood operates also here3 so infra, dicerem (sense being
‘ when I shall speak '). With this reading the sentence is ironical :
‘I who hesitate not to consess my own fault dare not, forsooth,
⁴ aeknowledge that os L.’; the real fact being (ξ 9) that it was no
fault to have been in Africa. But Quint. (v. 10, 93) reads de
Ligarii audeam dicere, and so also Codd. A H., Ἰ (10 not hesi-
tate to speak of what 1 did, and so Ι venture to say that L. was in
Africa?

propinquam cognationem, n. on § 1 ε Cicero assumes an air
of patronage towards his young antagonist.

ad meum aliquem fructum, ‘that in the glory of a young
kinsman Ι have some degree of personal interest.' For the use of
the possessive pronoun ‘ profit to me,’ cp. tuo eum maximo malo,
and such phrases. V. Marc. ξ 22 n.

sed hoe quaero, breaking off and returning to the main subject ; Q 9,
‘ however my question is this.’ et ipse, like Ligarius. et certe, ⁸
emphasising (in Ligarius' favour) one point of difference between the
career of Tubero and that of Ligarius. (Cicero ignores Thapsus. in
which surely Ligarius must have fought). The unusual phrasing
eontra. Caesarem (instead of cum) enforces the thought.

acie Pharsalica, the expression occurs for the first time here.
Quintilian notes four figures of speech in this passage : apostrophe,
metaphor (sensus armorum tuorum, ‘ the intention,' personifying
the arms) ; rhetorical question, and its amplification by accumulation
(congeries or συναθροισμός) of synonymous words and thoughts.
(Quint. ix. 2, 38: viii. 4, 27 ε 'viii. 6, 12 : viii. 4, 26).

quae tua menS‚ ete.‚ ‘on what was your strong resolve, those
eyes, that arm, that fiery spirit bent? ’ So in Greek τίς, as in

τίνας ποθ’ ἕδρας τάσδε μοι θοάζετε;

‘ what means this your suppliant session ? ’ Soph. O. T. 2.

hic, Caesar. Cp. n. on ξ 7 init. ξ 10.

eorum ipsorum, transposed to emphasise the ‘argumentum ex
contrario.'

quod esset, interrogative. The charge of Tubero is cited by
Quintilian as an instance of the ‘ genus turpe, causarum.'

isto modo, ‘ as you have doue.’ The reference to the second
person in iste can seldom be neglected in translating3 ep. infra
