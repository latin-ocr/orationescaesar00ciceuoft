PRO MAR CELLO.

Italian levies had been called out. He took little or no part in the
civil war3 having been among the first to leave Italy, he retired
from the struggle aster Pharsalus, equally disinclined to make his
peace with the conqueror and to follow the desperate sortunes of
the conquered. He withdrew into voluntary exile at Mytilene',
and consoled himself during the next two years for the loss os
country friends and means by the study of philosophy and rhetoric

under Cratippus ², as unwilling to receive a pardon as Caesar was to
grant it. It was his brother, C. Marcellus, and Cicero who laboured

most sor his return ³, to which his own consent was no less difficult
to gain than that of Caesar. It has been asked why Cicero exerted
himself thus for one who had not hitherto been an intimate friend.
Partly, no doubt, he desired the presence of and counsel of one of
the staunchest of the Pompeian party. But at this time, feeling
that his own life at Rome was little better than exile ⁴, he is not
likely to have been so strongly affected by political considerations.
More probably he wished to make some reparation to his party for
his sainthearted withdrawal from the war, to justify his own position
by inducing the most rigid of surviving Pompeians to accept a
similar position, perhaps also to appear as the dispenser of the grace
of the conqueror to the conquered.

ξ 3. Be that as it may, it was in the summer of B.C. 46, after
Caesar’s fourfold triumph (over Gaul, Egypt, Pontus, and Africa),
that the subject of Marcellus’ restoration was raised in a meeting os
the Senate by L. Piso, consul B.C. 58, and Caesar's stepson: C.
Marcellus immediately threw himself at the dictator's feet, and the
Senate rose in a body to support his petition. The scene has for-
tunately been described for us by Cicero himself in a letter to
Ser. Sulpicius (ad Fam. iv. 4), of which an extract is appended⁵.
Caesar, after contrasting unfavourably the rancorous spirit of Mar—
cellus with the moderation of Sulpicius, and complaining of the per-
sonal danger to which he exposed himself by his leniency ⁶, consented
to the surprise of all, to waive his personal feelings in deference to
the Senate’s wish. It seems that upon this the question of Marcellus'
restoration was sormally put to the vote ἐ this enabling the senators
