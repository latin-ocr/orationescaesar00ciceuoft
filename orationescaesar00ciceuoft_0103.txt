iustis hostilibusque, the second word explains the first ε ‘ a war
properly so called, waged against a forezgrn soe‚’ hostis: in this case
against Mithradates. Cp. iusta victoria, iustus exereitus, iustum im-
perium (Lig. § 27). ⁴ regular.'

evocatus: chosen with some allusion to the technical sense, a
veteran who has served his time but is called out again on special
terms by the State ε cp. the German ‘ Landwehr.'

infinitam, ⁴ vague,' ‘ indefinite.'

showing it to be natural in the victor and not the vanquished.
