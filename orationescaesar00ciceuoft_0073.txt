prudens et, sciens, ‘ with my eyes open.’ So ad Fam. l. e. ut in
fabulis Amphiaraus, sic ego prudens et sciens ‘ad pestem ante oculos
positam ’ sum profectus.
⁸ integra re, ‘before the die was cast.‘ Literal meaning of in— ξ 15,
teger? Cp. Lig. ξ 1 n.

sensi, of political views.

tam iniustus existimator rerum, ‘ so unfair in his judgments’ :
so 5 22 tam ignarus rerum, ‘ so blind!

ceteris fuerit iratior; we should subordinate instead of co-ordi—
nating: ‘ while he was very angry with the rest.’

qui . . . diligit, is . . . declarat, ‘ in that he shows his esteem, he
declares? The causal subj. might have been used with qui. Cp.
what was said on 5 13, cum . . . conservavit. Here the actors are
identified, and thereby the acts.

huius . . . rei, sc. pacis auctorem fuisse. ᾖ 16,

certorum hominum, as iu Deiot. ς 11, ‘of certain men who
shall be nameless': such as L. Lentulus and L. Domitius Aheno·
barbus (Momms. iv. ΙΙ. pp. 396-398, Momms. abr. p. 460).

liberalitas, ‘ handsome conduct’ ε liberalis properly expresses the
attributes of a ‘free born citizen’: hence used (a) of generosity in
giving, a regia laus (Deiot. ξ 26) : (b) of generous behaviour (e. g. to
opponents), as here and ξ 19 infra, also Lig. ἐξ 6, 23, 31: (c) of
‘ liberal pursuits ' as opposed to servilia opera, liberalissima studia
pro Arch. ξ 9.—The earlier sense ‘handsome in appearance' is
found in Plaut.‚ e.g. pulcer et l.‚ Mil. Gl. i. 1. 60.

gladium vagina vacuum, a sort of hypallage not unnatural in ᾧ 17 .
extempore speaking. Corn. Nepos has vagina nudatum (Dat. xi. 4).
Cp. use of plenus in Sex. Rosc. 5 6 in pecuniam tam plenam in-
vaserit.

excitaret, ‘ would raise,’ for the normal excitaturus fuerit: the
subj. may be said to do double duty here, as hypothetical and as
following quin: in such a case the substituted apodosis is usually
preferred (R. 1521, P. V. ξ 420). But the construction may be
justified by the simple force of the imperf. ; si f. posset . . . excitabat,
‘ if it had been at the time possible, he was ready to raz'se.‘

partis, how governed?

quidam enim, etc.: the letters belonging to the time of the ᾧ 18.
first civil war are sull os this: even of Pompeius himself Cicero
says ‘sullaturit animus eius et proscripturit iam diu' (ad Att. ix.
10. 6).

qui . . . excitaverunt, ‘ in that they raised ' ε an indicative qni-
