PRO REGE DEIOTARO ORATIO.

disciplinam, prop. ‘instruction ' (discipulus): so Lig. § 20: then
‘ moral practice’ in accordance with a certain rule os life.

pudor animi, pudicitia corporis: ‘honourable feeling and be-
havioun’

in illam aetatem: what difference would ‘istam‘ make in the
sense?

tamen explained by iam exacta aetate = ‘in spite of his pro-
ficiency when he was a younger man, now in his old age‚' &c. Cp.
si followed by tamen in ξ ²5 acl fin.

haerere, of a firm seat in the saddle; Hor. C. iii. 24. 54—-

Nescit equo rudis Ι haerere ingenuus puer.

meus in Cilicia miles, v. Introd. ξ 3 and note: in Graecia,
under Pompeius.

exercitu Pompeiano: post Pharsalicum proelium probably
a gloss to explain this.

qm· pacis semper auctor fui, v. Marc. ξ 14 and noles.

ponendorum = deponendorum, which most MSS. read, but not
AH. Cp. coluber positis novus exuviis Verg. A. ii. 473, and
Marc. ξ 31 arma posita.

abiciendorum: the best comment on this contrast is ad Fam. vi. 2
armis aut condicione positis aut defetigatione abiectis aut victoria
detractis, ⁴ arms laid down by capitulation or thrown down in wean'-
ness or taken off in the honr of success.' Contrast proicere arma, ‘to
throw away' in a panic.

auctoritatem, concrete Ξ eam sententiam cuius auctor (‘advo-
cate'* sui.

patri satis faciendum, ‘must meet the wishes of his father':
cp. ξ 15 for metaphorical application of the phrase.

calamitosus, and calamitas, often used with immediate reser-
ence to a legal conviction: opposed to incolumis. Cp. Lig. § 16.

sint sane inimicitiae, Marc. ξ 22 n.; taken up in a different
form after the parenthesis by sed quamvis, etc.

tuum patrem . . . quis esset. . . audivit ε subject of the dependent
clause attracted into the principa] sentence as its object. Far corn-
moner in Greek than in Latin prose: ad Fam. viii. 10 nosti Mar-
cellum, quam tardus sit. So in older English: e. g. Bp. Latimer,
(Sermons'. ‘who is the most diligentest Bishop in all England?
I can tell, for 1 know him who it is.'

hominum more: wc should rather say ‘like gentlemen': cp.
Cicero's account of his reception of Caesar and his retinue‚ ‘quid
multa? homines visi sumus,' ‘in a word, I showed that 1 was a
gentleman’ (ad Att. xiii. 52). And Nero’s remark on the com-
