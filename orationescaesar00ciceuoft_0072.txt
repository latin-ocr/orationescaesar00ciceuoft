PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO.

fato nescio quo, ‘ mysterious fatality.' Lig. § 17 fatalis quaedam
calamitas.

erroris, gen. of definition‚ R. 1302, K. 248, P. V. 143. Cp. the
well-known plea of Ovid—

caelestique viro quis me deceperit error
dicite, pro culpa ne scelus esse putet.

humani, apologetic. So in Ter. humanumst ‘it is a failing of
humanity.’

cum . . . conservavit . . . induxit: the causal subj. (conserva-
verit) might have been used with cum. But the indic. construction
is far more forcible, identifying the acts : ‘ in having preserved, he
has (ipso sacto) introduced? So Deiot. ξ 36, R. 1729 (Prof. Hale,
The cum-constructions, Part ii. p. 22 3, may very well be con-
sulted). Where does the apodosis begin?

quorum et frequentiam et dignitatem . . . videtis, ‘ whom you
see in large numbers and in full enjoyment of their dignities.’ Cp.
n. on ξ 10 illa auctoritas.

hostes, sc. patriae: ‘traitors.' Thus Q. Ligarius was accused
before Caesar on what was virtually a charge of perduellio.

cupiditate, ‘ personal ambition ' : the opposite of integritas
‘purity of motives.’ It is the discreditable aspect of spes (ξ 14).
So in § 20 im'ra, Lig. βξ 3, 17. The word may also mean (a) ‘ party
feeling‚' Lig. ξ 3 init. where in the chiasmus it answers to studii sui :
(b) ‘ partiality‘ of judgment. Mares 29 : cp. the phrase omnia alicui
cupere.

In a digression Cic. defends his own conduct. Cp. ad Fam.
vii. 3. 6 ‘ Ι wished to tell you, if only by letter, what to say if you
should meet my calumniators: there are some who, though my
death could not have done the state any good, think that Ι may
fairly be called to account sor being alive.' .

de paee audiendum, sc. esse nobis, ‘ we ought to entertain any
peace-proposals.'

orationem civium: he means himself ; pacis semper auctor fui
Lig. ξ 28, Deiot. ξ 29.

hominem, very emphatic; ‘the man Pompeius’ as opposed to
‘ P. the general.' So Cic. writes to Ρ., ‘ 1 do not complain that my
plan [viz. further negotiation] was not adopted: I followed yours,
not in the cause of the Republic, of which Ι despaired . . . but I
sought you, I wished to be with you' (ad Att. viii. 11. 6).

grati animi fidelis memoria, ‘ a gratitude too loyal to forget.'
Elsewhere he writes, ‘ I was afraid to fail Pompeius in his hour of need,
when he ona past occasion had not failed me in mine' (ad F am.vi. 6. 6).
