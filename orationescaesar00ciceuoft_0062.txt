INTRODUCTIQN.

we should expect in an impromptu speech transen'bed pretty faith-
fully?

(c) The introduction of Stoic doctrines into the speech (55 19, 2 5,
27, 30) is criticised, as also betraying the hand osa rhetorician. And
yet one passage in pro R. Deiot. is no less technical, viz. ξ 37.

(d) An elaborate argument seeks to establish the presence of ana-
chronisms. In particular, the legislation demanded from Caesar in
ξ 23 had been, if we may believe one critic ¹, for some weeks in
existence when Caesar pardoned Marcellus; which last event he
assigns to the autumn (Sept—Oct. B.c. 46) not the summer².

(e) A story of Plutarch's in reference to the delivery of the pro
Ligario is held to exclude the existence of a Marcelliana: namely
that when the orator appeared with his friend, Caesar said, ‘ What
is there to prevent us from gising a hearing to Cicero after tlzz's lapse
qf time (διὰ χρόνου), since the accused has long ago been adjudged
a malignant and an enemy? ’ (Plut. Cic. 39.) The phrase in question
is too xague to prove much: and the anecdotes of Plutarch are
not always credible.

(j) The Speech has been attacked sor its attitude both towards
Caesar and towards the memory of Pompeius: for fulsome praise of
the one, and disloyalty to the othe1·³. Some want of taste, if we
are to apply modern standards, must be conceded ε our own oratory
is more measured in its epithets. But the occasion, as Cicero
conceived it, sufficiently accounts for his language. The vision of a
restored republz'c rose before his eyes, when Caesar granted the
pardon of the most stubbom of Pompeians to the prayers of the
Senate 4: it seemed to him the περιπέτεια in the drama of absolutism:

some evidence on the other side3 v. ς 91 facibus, falcibus, ξ 30 vi
victa xis vel potius oppressa virtute audacia, ξ 32 adiuvantibus,
coniventibus: and especially the constant antithesis of words and
clauses throughout, e. g. ξ 52.

tioned, before ad Fam. vi. 6, in which he is, He dates the former
September ²4 (new sty;le) and applies the arg. a silent2'30 which 1s
never conclusive.
