PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO.

quoted (cp. ad Fam. iv. 4, 3) se senatui roganti ne hominis quidem
causa (⁴ in consideration of the personal character of M.’) negaturum.

illae is redundant, merely sharpening the antithesis of celebra.—
buntur quidem with what follows (sed tamen, etc.). Cp. infra ξ
11: Lig. ς 30: Deiot. ς 27. '

obstrepi elamore militum, ‘to be drowned by the eries of
battle.' This personal use of obstrepo in the passive is a ἅπαξ εἰρημένον
in Cicero.

ut . . velis, ‘ whose mind and thoughts we see reflected in your
face, how you wish.' Ut explains mentem sensusque, with which
os must be taken closely. Faernus conjectures sensusque eos needlessly.

parietes . . gratias agere gestiunt: a favourite hyperbole in
Cic.‚ ascribing emotion or utterance to inanimate nature. Cp.
Cluent. ξ 15 <nonne timuisse) parietes ipsos, superiorum testes nupti-
arum : Mil. § 20 the fields themselves mourn the loss of a beneficent
citizen. Common of course in poetry: ep. Hor. C. iv. 11. 6—

ridet argento domus: ara castis
vincta verbenis avet immolato
spargier agno.

illa auetoritas=vir illa auctoritate praeditus, referring to Mar-
cellus: ‘his honoured presence.' A strong instance of ‘res pro
persona ’ (abstract for concrete). Cp. the well-known

virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli,
and ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιοε there we find the original form of the idiom,
in which the genitive of the person is conjoined (v. infr. ς 13:
Lig. ᾗ 33). Here the abstract noun by itself is so concrete that
suorum, suis refer to the person involved in it. Cp. Deiot. ξ 30

C. Marcelli, own brother of M. Marcellus, consul B.C. 49: it
has been supposed from Phil. xiii. ξ 29 (which, however, does not
necessarily imply this), that he died soon after leaving Italy. In
ad Att. xv. 3 he is mentioned as alive in B. C. 44. We need not there-
fore'suppose that this optimus et amantissimus frater (infra ξ 34) was
his first cousin Caius, cos. Β. C. 50.

omnium Marcellorum meum peetus memoria obfudit. z a very
strange expression if it stands as Cicero wrote it. We can say (e. g.)
oculis tenebras offundere ‘to shed darkness on the eyes’ ; and by an
inversion may say oculos tenebris offundere. Thus memoria is
the abl. ‘ C. Marcellus flooded my heart with memories of all the
Marcelli ' z a turgid metaphor, but lacrimas suggests it. (There is
absolutely nothing to support the view that obfudit can in sense
