PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO.

K. 101 n 2, P. V. 282). For the double gen.‚ depending on flumen,
cp. Lig. § 12 studia familiae vestrae virtutis: but the governing
noun generally, as here, stands between the genitives. The subjec-
tive gen. (as in both cases) usually precedes the obj. gen.

flumen ingenii, cp. flumen orationis, and Juvenal (of Cicero
and Demosthenes) utrumque Ι largus et exundans leto dedit ingenii
fons, and Gray, ‘ And froze the genia] current of the sou1.’ So quasi
quidam aestus ingenii tui Cic. de Orat. iii. § 145. Cp. Introd. Ι. § 3 a.

non dicam (sometimes non modo) . . . sed, a descent from a stronger
to a weaker term, ‘ I will not say, dignify, but merely, describe' ι
exornare, ornate, enmare, plene dicere (Eb.).

ante oen-Ios ponere, ‘ call up in thought ²: in Phil. ii. ξ 115 it is
equivalent to recordari, in Deiot. ξ 20 to repetere memoriam. Gener-
ally used with dat. of personal prononn, or with possessive pron.
ζ ponite ante oculos vobis or vestros).

eeleritate conficiendi: ‘ that element of warsare, the treatment
of which serves to distinguish military genius from the mere ordinary
ability of an officer—the rapid movement of masses‚’ Mommsen
(Eng. tr.) vol. iv, part ii, p. 453. Cp. Caesar's veni, vidi, vici.

Notice the change of tense in potuisse, ‘Nor could anyone have
marched over countries the most widely separated in less time than
you have taken to triumph over them, I might have said, to overrun
them in triumph ’ : passus applicable to an ordinary march, cursus
to a forced march.

sunt, indic. in spite of the oratio obliqua ; but after a main verb
in the first person (soleo . . . usurpare sermonibus) the mood of
direct statement often slips in.

ita magna . . ut ea vix cuiusquam, etc., ‘greater than mind
or thought can conceive': English adopts the more exaggerated
form of expression. Cp. Deiot. ξ 5.

communicare cum multis, ete„ ‘to give a share in them to
various people, instead of making them the exclusive property of the
general ’ : communes ducibus cum multis aliis sacere. Cp. n. on
ξ 22 communis. This use of communicare has been attaeked: sor
usually it implies ‘ to give another a share of what one has oneself.'
Still the antithesis justifies the slight stretch os usage.

locorum opportunitas, ‘ a favourable position ' : v. n. on Deiot.
ξ, 15 importunitas. Caesar himself would have been the last man to
deny the part played by ‘ Fortune' in his campaigns: e. g. B. G.
vi. 35 hic, quantum in bello fortuna possit et quantos afferat casus,
cognosci potuit. ‘ The feeling was never absent from his heart that
in all things fortune, that is to say accident, must bestow success;
