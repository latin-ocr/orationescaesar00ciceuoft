For the circumstance v. Lig. ξ 7.

equidem, a strengthened quidem (μέν) : here answers to sed below.
Cp. n. on Lig. ς 30.

quocum mihi, etc.‚ ‘to whom Ι am bound by a friendship
cemented by politica] considerations‚ a tie of hospitality contracted by
reciprocal inclination‚ an intimacy which is the growth of constant
intercourse, above an, by a bond of devotion created by his great
services to myself and my army ' ε an ascending series.

semel, v. n. on ξ 8 : the idea is emphasised by the use os perf.
inf. pass (completed action) after oportet. Cp. my π. on Cluent.
ξ 129: and R. 1371 d (RV. 381).

nulhus, n. on Marc. ξ 4.

propone tibi ante oculos, Marc. ξ 5. For the co-ordination with

supponit: cp. supposititius of a reserve gladiator, to take the place
of (sub—) the vanquished.

memoriam tuam : a remarkable memory is attributed to Caesar
in Lig. ξ 35 and Phil. ii. ξ 116 : and may be illustrated' by the story
of a lawsuit in which the defendant, one of Caesar's veterans, reminds
him of a trifling incident in his Spanish wars (Seneca, de benef. v. 24),
he had' sprained his ankle and was resting in a rough place on the
march, and the soldier had brought him water in his helmet.

pedem discessisse unum : cp. the colloquial phrase transversum
digitum or unguem discedere: for the accus, v. R. 1086, P.V. 303
ζ K. 282).

preceding antithesis: hence the neuter gender.
