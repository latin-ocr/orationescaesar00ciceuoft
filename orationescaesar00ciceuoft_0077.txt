been destined to such an issue as this. that after the overthrow os
your antagonists you should allow the state to rest in its present
oposition? The sequence (perfect proper followed by imperf. subj.)
is noteworffiy, but is now recognised in all good grammars: it must
be remembered that aster all the pers. proper and the aorist (or his-
torical perfect) are denoted by one and the same form in Latin: v.
RV. ξ 389 (a), R. 1510 (Allen, Lat. Gr. ξ 207, and Sonnenschein,
Parallel Gr. 519, 520).

status, not ‘state‘ but a ‘fixed position' or ‘ posture‘: Leg.
Agr. i. § 26 si status hic rci publicae maneat.

vide .. . ne . . . sit habitura, ‘ I arn afraid it is likely to have '; so
Phil. ii. ξ 35 vide, quaeso, ne haereas, ¹ Ι am afraid you may find the
question embarrassing' (Mayor's n.): also R. 1656: P.V. § 397,

nown.' Observe the artistic order of the words—an inner and an
outer bracket: the prepositional phiase in suos . . . hominum is
bracketed between the noun which it qualifies (meritorum) and its
adj. magnorum : the bracket magnorum . . . meritorum is bracketed
between the governing noun fama and its adjectives‚ with this modi-
fication, that meritorum as a sonorous word is allowed to stand
outside the bracket, ending the sentence. Cp. Postgate, Sermo
Latinus, p. 31.

para, ‘part ’ of the play, i. e. act: not a ‘ part ‘ in the play, which ᾧ 27.
would be partes. Cp. de Senect. ξ 5 where ceterae partes aetatis are
opposed to extremus actus.—For the stage-metaphor cp. Thuc. ii. 42
(Pericles' Funeral Speech) ἡ νῦν τῶνδε καταστροφή, ‘the elosing scene
of their lives.'

restat, v. § 32 n.: Lig. ξ 5 n.

cum et patriae . . . vivendi, ‘when you have met the claims
of your country upon you, and more than satisfied the mere law of
nature.'

dicito, fut. imperative so-called, frequent in the language of law
and maxim, from a certain formality of tone, ‘you may say.' R.

hoc ipsum serves as a kind of article to introduce diu: cp. its
use with infin. hoc ipsum nihil agere me delectat. Cic. de Orat. ξ 24.

extremum, a subst. =finis3 futura. an adj. here like praeterita.
