NOTES: CHAP. J. ξ 2-lll. ξ 9.

quae . . . leviora, ‘considerations which give me the strongest
grounds sor hoping to make the truth victorious, but are weak in-
centives to energetic and ardent oratory.’

eodem, ‘in the same way’: Cicero is anxious not to be thought § 6.
to quarrel with Caesar’s sole judicature in the case.

meminisset, subj. by assimilation, K. ᾖ 468. R. 1778, K. 468.

curiam: Hostiliam, at the Ν.Ε. corner of the sorum, to the left
of the orator as he would speak there.

pro multis saepe dixisti: Caesar was a pupil of the Rhodian ᾧ 7.
rhetorician Molo, and became one of the greatest orators of the
day, second only (some say) to Cicero. His speeches were never
collected for publication.

quid mihi . .. referre, ‘to estimate by the standard of your
own experienee my present feelings': in fact, ‘to put yourself in
my place!

antequam . . . dico, pres. for fut. (as in Mil. ξ 7 antequam ad
earn orationem venio, videntur ea esse refutanda, etc.)‚ R. 1462,
P. V. 410 n.‚ K. 431.

rerum, Marc. 5 22 n.

adfectum: there is good MS. authority for afflictum, ‘ humbled‚' ᾧ 8.
which can describe the temper of one who is plotting revenge: v.
Verg. A. ii. 9², 96 of Sinon.

detrimentis: the limits of his kingdom were curtailed z v.
Introd. 5 4.

teque cum . . . cognoverant, bracketed by Madvig not without
reason; they are inconsistent in tense with iratum fuisse above3
nor is Cicero likely to have called Caesar the friend of such men as
Castor and Phidippus. But, as in ς 29, he may refer to Castor and
his father.

ut in . . . insideret, ‘ that in a mind rankling with resentment a
false charge would easily take root.'

inquam, Marc. ξ 7 n.

non tam . . . firmiorem, a natural confusion, between ⁴ not so steady
in war as it is in promises‚' and ‘ steadier in promises.’ ‘ Not as steady
in war . . . as it is doubly steady in the performance of a promise.’
Still the finish vof Cicero’s style perhaps excludes such an anomaly;
and tam is bracketed accordingly. (Priscian had it in his text.)

semel, ‘once for all’ : so ξ 39 semel ignotum. ξ 9.

senserit=‘ knew to his cost,’ as often in Hor. z C. ii. 7, 10 tecum
Philippos sensi (v. Page).

quamquam: Marc. ξ 27 adfin„ note.

cum Deiotaro querellae: so tecum queri, tecum expostulare.
