The sense os the lost words is nulla pacis cogitatio.

pacis . . . fui, cp. Marcell. § 14.

erat . . . amentis: Indic. regularly used for subj. in such im-
personal phrases: nonne suit satius? Verg. E. ii. 14. RV. 417 b., R.
1535. For indefinite 2ud pers. v. Deiot. § 4 n.

nunc, n. on ξ 16 ad fin. A good ex. of the dilemma follows. ξ 29.

'rubero . . . vos, ‘you and your father': cp. vestras, Eure,
domos, ‘ yours and your brethren's‚’ Verg. A. i. 140.

not refer to a single end which I have in view, to touch your
humanity or your lenieney or your pity, as the case may be':

a strengthened form of quidem, though by Cicero's time (with
possibly three exceptions) only used with first person and=‘I for
my part.' Cp. antithetic use of illae quidem in Marcell. ξ 9. There
is a pleonasm in the use of the pronominal word in either case. For
Caesar as an advocate cp. Deiot. ξ 7.

public positions.’ Cp. temporis ratio, ‘ exigencies of the situation.'

bello oppressus, ‘ overtaken by,' ‘ surprised by the outbreak os
the war.'

arroganter, sc. oro.
