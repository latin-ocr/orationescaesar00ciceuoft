PRO M, MARCELLO ORATIO.

diuturnum quidem quicquam videtur in quo est aliquid extremum,
¹ nothing seems to me even so much as long, if it has an end
to it?

quamquam, ‘ and yet‚’ a mere particle of transition, introducing-
a correction, or reservation from the previous statement. R. 2215.

ina, inquam, illa vita, est tua: the usual order is illa illa in-
quam z v. § 7 note and reff.

aeternitas, an equivalent sor ‘eternity’ in most phrases: so Tusc.
i. 94 confer nostram longissimam aetatem cum aeternitate. But ‘ for
all eternity ⁹ is in perpetuum or in aeternum.

huie, sc. posterity to all time.

pugnas innumerabiles, incredibiles victorias, a chiasmus, or
‘crossing' of opposites V. R. ξ 1051, P.V. ξ 438. 4.

munera, ‘largesses ’3 cp. the technical meaning ‘a gladiatorial
show ' as given by the aedile to the people; v. Lewis and Short.

nisi belli civilis incendium salute patriae restinxeris : ‘ un—
less you stifle the smouldering remnants of civil war by the restora-
tion of your country’s liberties ‘z a bold metaphor 2 cp. pro Mur. ξ 51
ἰ(1 (incendium) se non aqua sed ruina restincturum.

cupiditate, v. ξ 13.

quidam, the Epicureans—and Caesar himself, if his speech in the
<lebate on the sate of the Catilinarian eonspirators be historical—
⁴ mortem cuncta mortalium mala dissolvere ; ultra neque curae neque
gaudio locum esse.' Sall. Cat. li. Falso therefore was bracketed
by XVeiske: it is too dogmatie sor Cicero, is inconsistent with the
fut. pertinebit, and calculated to offend Caesar.

voluntates, ‘ political leanings.' Cp. with the whole passage
Lig. § 19.

non enim . . . dissidebamuS‚ ‘it was not merely a conflictos
poliey and partisanship‚ but of drawn swords and opposing camps.'

obscuritas, ‘ perplexity’: cp. Lig. l. c. causa dubia. The word
has become subjective: cp. indignitas ‘indignati0n,' in Livy.—In
what follows, higher motives (duty, honour) are given in contrast
with lower (expediency, sear of consequences).

eosdem, ‘ sor that simple reason.'

profudit: Hor. C. i. 12. 37 animaeque magnae prodigum Paullum.

quae enim . . . potest : this gives the reason for ille melior sit :
better those who fought to the bitter end [the Pompeians in Africa]
than those who accepted Caesar's pardon and then plotted against
him : ‘ for what some people may consider in them obstinacy, others
(including themselves> may consider fidelity!

fracta est armis victor-18, extincta est aequitate victoris.
