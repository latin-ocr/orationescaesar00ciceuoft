PRO REGE DEIOTARO ORATIO.

and the power of Rome herself in that quarter. He had the discem-
ment to see that his safety lay in unswerving loyalty to the cause of
Rome in her contest with Mithradate53 and his services rendered
between the years B. C. 88 and 63 were publicly acknowledged by '
successive generals, Sulla, Murena, Lucullus, Pompeius ¹. The last
named, in his settlement of Asiatic affairs, rewarded him with a sub-
stantia] slice of territory, the part of Pontus east of the Halys and
including the maritime towns of Pharnaceia and Trapezus. The
settlement of Pompeius was confirmed on Caesar’s proposal in his
consulship, Rc. 59, the Senate further bestowing upon Deiotarus
the kingly title and the district of Lesser Armenia. '

at the disposal of the Roman governors in that region, viz. Cicero
himself when pro-consul of Cilicia (B. C. 51), and M. Bibulus when
pro-consul of Syria. The civil war broke out in B. C. 49; and
Deiot. decided for Pompeiu5‚ partly on the ground of greater personal
obligations, partly no doubt because in Asia his name stood far
higher than that os Caesar. In spite of his advanced age he took
the field in person at the head of 600 horsemen, attended Pompeius
in his flight after the battle of Pharsalus, but parted from him in
Lesbos, under promise to raise the peoples of the East in his cause:
a promise which he was never called upon to redeem. It was not
long after Pompeius' death that Pharnaces, son of Mithradates, and
king of the district of the Cimmerian Bosporus, in the hope of
regaining his father’s dominions invaded Lesser Armenia and Cap-
padocia. Deiot. in alarm united his forces with those of Cn.
Domitius Calvinus, Caesar's lieutenant in Asia, with the result that
they both were defeat—ed at Nicopolis in Lesser Armenia, and Phar-
naces was master of Pontus. Caesar himself, victorious in Egypt,
hastened through Syria and Cappadocia to the borders of Pontus
and Galatia : where he was met by Deiot., who had put off his regal
attire and was clad in the garb of a suppliant criminal. He granted
him the pardon he asked‚ but did not accept his excuse that ‘it had
