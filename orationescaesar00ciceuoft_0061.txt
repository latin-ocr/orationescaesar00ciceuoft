PRO MARCELLO.

templaque demolitur et obscurat oblivio [cp. Marc. ξ 30] . . . contra,
contemptor ambitionis et infinitae potestatis domitor ac frenator

’ animus ipsa vetustate florescit: ξ 3 the use os fructum capere with

ib. lxviii. 1, capis ergo, Caesar, salutis tuae gloriosissimum fructum
ex consensu deorum. Many minuter parallels may be found in Val.
Max. and Pliny (the Letters as well as the Panegyric) ¹.

(c) Two passages in the philosophical treatises of B.c. 44, viz. de
Amic. § 29 and de Senect. 5 69, read as though they were expansions
of sentences in pro Marc. ξ 9 and § 27 respectively. The impugners
of the speech have made a great deal of them: as though the
parallelism could only be explained by deliberate transcription, and
not by unconscious sels-repetition. In the same way the coincidences
of language with the Letters os the period (especially ad Fam. iv. 4)
have been cited to prove that the pro Marcello is a sort of cento of
Ciceronian sentences, a declamatio written by some student in the
schools of the early Empire, and redolent of their rhetoric and
philosophy.

§ 3. The arguments against the authenticity of the speech have
been in part anticipated. They relate to style and to subject-matter.

(a) Wolf has drawn up a formidable indictment against the dictionq
after due allowauce made sor the imperfectiori of his text, there is a
residuum of usages which must be pronounced not Ciceronian or at
least ἅπαξ εἰρημένα in Cicero. We refer to ς 4 flumen ingenii, ξ 8
victoriam temperare (but v. note there), ς 9 use of obstrepi, ξ 10 use
os obfudit, ξ 17 gladium vagina vacuum, § 21 quae (suspicio)
providenda est, and perhaps the formula of resumption at the
beginning os ξ 33.

(b) A certain artificiality of composition has been noted; the
constant repetition of the same word, alliteration‚ and paronomasia.
Ε. g. in § 12 vincere in different forms occurs nine times in eleven
lines3 so in ξ 8, with other alliteration. There is frequent parallelism
or ‘responsion' of clauses. All this, it is said, is far more in the
style of Cicero's earliest than of his later speeches ²². Would it not
be truer to say that these, the simplet tricks of rhetoric, are just what
