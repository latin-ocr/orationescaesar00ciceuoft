PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO.

venistis ad Pompeium: strong instance of asyndeton adver-
sativum.

apud Caesarem, ‘ at the bar os Caesar.'

a quo queramini prohibitos esse vos=a quo, ut querimini,
prohibiti sitis, virtual or. obliqua, hence snbj. Cp. the subj. mood of
the verbum dicendi in such a case as quod diceret (R. 1746).

gloriemini per me lieet, lit. ‘ you are allowed to boast as far as 1
am concerned ’ ε ⁴ you have my leave to ' ε cp. use osper in Deiot. ξ 37.

constantiam : the accuser declared, according to Quintilian,
‘Ligarium perseverasse ‘: but that he himself ‘ ut primum licuerit
a partibus recessisse)

quamvis . . . probarem, ‘however much 1 approved‘ : a con-
ditional snbj. here, hence the tense.

patientia is ‘endurance of the inevitable' or in a bad sense ‘ os
some discomfort as though it were inevitable ' : ‘ passive endurance,'
whereas constantia is ‘ manly endurance.' Cp. Hor. C. i. 24. 19—

levius fit patientia
quidquid corrigere est nefas.

quotus . . . quisque lit. : ‘ each how many-eth ’ : so ‘ how few?
Quintus quisque, optimus quisque, πολλοστὸν μόριον (‘ever so small a
fraction ') are similarly to be explained.

ad eos ipsos, sc. ‘ men os the same party’ as those in Africa.
But Codd. H A have ad eas ipsas partis which may be the right
reading ε the repetition os the antecedent is Ciceronian (cp. my n. on
Cluent. ξ 49), but might easily be unsamiliar to a copyist.

ut concessive : with the sentence cp. § 26 quamvis ipse probarem,
ut probo.

iusto, ‘regular,’ conferred with due formalities. A rhetorical
exaggeration (as is suam): cp. ξς 20, 21 in contrast. Caesar him-
self (B. Civ. i. 6] notes the irre g'ularzty of the Senate’s proceedings;
provinces were conferred on private persons without the sanction os
the Comitia, which alone could bestow the imperzum.

aliquam, ‘some country or other’: cp. use in ξ 22: so Verg.
A. ii: 48 aut aliquis latet error. In certain contexts thus it =alius quis.

eausam, personal, as a qua shews: ‘ party.' So in Rosc. Am.
ξ 142 qui et se et causam laedi putet, ‘ who conceives himself and
the good cause affronted,’ a very concrete use.

ista, n. on ξ 10.

credo generally parenthetical and ironical in Cic. ‘I presumc
your zeal in the cause cooled somewhat.'

in praesidiis as in § 30, ‘ on active service’: this phrase chosen
because it implies acting on the defensive ‘in the trenches,' as it
