PRO MARCELLO.

his despair os the republic had suddenly given place to confidence in
her regenerator, his terror of proscription¹ and feeling os isolation to
a sense of seeurity and even dignity. This reaction os feeling
explains what there is of hyperbole and declamatory emphasis iu
the speech. What seems artificial (cp. supra 2), is really natural
in the highest degree. No one claims for Cicero a faculty of political
prescience. But ‘the eulogies which he showers upon Caesar, when
we remember his design in bestowing them, lose to some degree the
air of servility which has been made their reproach ².¹

ξ 4. The Marcelliana can take care of itself. The critic may
shake our saith by pointing out this and that flaw in its workman-
ship3 we return to the speech itself and are reassured. But how are
we to account sor these ‘ egregio inspersos corpore naevos '? Eber-
hard suggests that the speech has come down to us exactly as it was
taken down by shorthand writers in the senate⁸ : and exhibits a few
os the inaccuracies of improvisation. Again, it may have happened
that Cicero draughted in the rough a copy of his speech after making
it : and that for some reason (possibly the death of Marcellus or his
own subsequent attitude towards Caesar) he never gave it a final
revision for publication. Others—perhaps Tiro—may have pub-
lished it aster his death ; so that here and there the hand of another

may be traceable. It is significant that the exact title of the speech
is uncertain. But this fact tells against rather than sor the ‘ pseud-
epigraphic ’ theory. In dealing with a similar question, Prof. Mahaffy
has remarked (Gk. Lz't. ii. 340) ‘how signally German critics have
their aesthetical judgments controlled by their critical conclusions‚
and in consequence how utterly unsafe they are as to questions of style!

sion of this Speech was the pardon by Caesar of one of his most
uncompromising enemies, M. Claudius Marcellus; it was delivered
late in the summer of Β. C. 46. The illustrious plebeian family of
the Marcelli had already given‘Rome four consuls of note, the most
