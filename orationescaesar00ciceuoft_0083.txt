tion supply the place of ὤν ἰη Greek3 so Milo § 21 sed homo
sapiens . . . multa vidit, ¹ but sagacious as he was.'

cum tu . . . potuisses, ‘thinking that you did not know‘:
virtually oblique and in dependence on paratus. Caesar would
appreciate the irony better than Q. Tubero.

abuterer, ‘use up’3 ‘to profit by your ignorance to save an
unfortunate man.‘ Cp. absorbeo, absumo.

esset, subj. imperf. after perf, Marc. ξ 26 n. Integrum, ‘an
open question‚' v. Marc. ᾗ 15 n.

habes igitur, Tubero, quoted by Quintilian (iv. 1. 67) as an ex. ξ 2,
of apostrophe, by which the speaker turns away from the jury or
judge and ⁴ apostrophises ’ someone else.

te ε by attraction. Cp. de Sen. ξ 1 te suspicor isdem rebus quibus
me ipfflm interdum gravius commoveri, ‘I fancy that you are dis-
turbed by the same things by which l am myself’

civibus, Roman citizens; sociiS, provincials.

alium : he would naturally have been succeeded by his quaestor.
Cicero slips into his statement of facts (narratio) more than one
argument in Ligarius' favour.

cupiditate, v. n. on Marc. ξ 13. ξ 3,

salutis, studii answer to timore, cupiditate (chiasmus), and ⁵
are differently related to ducem. ‘Some were carried away by
partisan feeling, others blinded by their fears; at first the thought
of peril, then that of party, led them to look for a chief.'

optinuerat, ‘had held’ at a previous time as propraetor (pro
praetore more strictly). V. Introd. § 2.

nullo publico consilio, cp. § 27 iusto cum imperio ex senatus
consilio. A lex curiata was necessary to confer imperium.

Observe that Cicero might have said non modo ad bellum, sed ne <x 4,
ad minimam quidem suspicionem belli est egressus. If the common ⁵
predicate stands in the latter of the clauses, the negative in the
former clause may be omitted.

ei, referred by some commentators to Ligarius: if ut gives the
objective result, this is grammatically possible. But it is better to refer
it to provincia: ‘he so acted as to make it the interest of the
province that the peace should not be broken.’ (Quintilian, quoting
in iv. 2. 108, substitutes z'llz'; which is in favour of this view.)

habuit, sc. in se, ⁴ was due to.’ ’

quod, acc. of time. ξ 5¹

restitit, ‘ stayed behind ’ ; cp. remansio supra, and v. Marc. ξ 32.
