more maiorum. . .1iceat: the same principle is more fully
stated in Mil. ξ 59; to examine a man's own slaves against himself
was thought ‘indignum et domini morte ipsa tristius'¹ : although in
such an examination &according to a strange illusion of the ancient
lawyers) ⁶ the tor-ture might elicit the truth even in the witness’ own
despite.’ At Athens it was a common thing to challenge an adver-
sary to give up his slaves to the torture, or to tender one's own
slaves: cp. the story of the mutilation of the Hermae, and the
revelations of Andocides, Grote's Greece, ch. lviii (and note on
torture). (V. also Poynton, pro Mil. Appendix i.)

superlative3 cp. Mare. ᾗ 6, note. (Quo nihil iniquius - ‘a most
unfair course.')
