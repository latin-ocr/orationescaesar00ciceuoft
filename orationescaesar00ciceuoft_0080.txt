PRO Q. LIGARIO.

INTRODUCTION.

ξ 1. As the pro Marcello stands alone among the speeches of
Cicero as an example of the panegyiic or rather gratiarum actio,
so the pro Ligario is the only deprecatio, or appeal to mercy, which
he has left us. The speech was greatly admired by the ancients
and is constantly quoted by Quintilian. The occasion which called
it forth may be briefly described.

ξ 2. Q. Ligarius, an eques of Sabine family, went to Africa in
Bc. 50 as legate to the propraetor, C. Considius Longus, who at the

Senate, acting according to constitutional usage, had nominated a

accuser in the present case. LigariuS, acting under the orders of
Varus, forbade Tubero to enter the harbour of Utica, and even to
take water on board, and set his ailing son Quintus on shore. The
Tuberones accordingly betook themselves to the camp of Pompeius
and were in arms against Caesar until they received his pardon after
the battle of Pharsalus. This was no doubt readily granted to men
of their literary ability and traditions. Q. Tubero, nephew of Scipio
Africanus Minor, had been a famous Stoic ; the elder Tubero was a
