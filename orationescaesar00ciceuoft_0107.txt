to reinforce Caesar iu Africa, who was at that time practically
blockaded at Ruspina a fort on the coast.

si, with tamen in the apodosis, is = etiamsi: especially is the
apodosis is also negative. So de leg. § 7 quem si adsequi posset,
aliquantum ab optimo tamen abesset : ‘ even if he could equal him,
he would still sall considerably short of the highest merit.’ And
pro Mil. § 72.

qui (the first), an adverb.

furcifer: applied to Phidippus as a slave: for the furca, Lewis Q 26,

in convivio nudum saltavisse: both Greeks and Romans re-
garded this mimelic dancing, generally an accompaniment of a
banquet performed by one or more hired dancers, as degrading to
those who took an active part in it. Cp. the story of King Philip
dancing at his revels after the battle of Chaeronea: and the classic
passage, pro Mur. ξ 13 nemo fere saltat sobrius, nisi forte insanit.—
This did not prevent the existence of ‘ludi saltatorii‚' dancing
schools, at Rome, in which boys and girls were taught, generally by
a Greek ‘ professor ¹ : although the sterner sort of Romans frowned
on them (cp. Sall. Catil. e. 25).

frugalitas, ‘ sense of propriety‚' or ‘sobriety' : explained in Tusc.
iii. ξ 16 as equivalent to σωφροσύνη, the steady government of the
passions‚ though in popular use it was applied most commonly to a
slave. The kingly virtues that follow are, by a piece of subtle
flattery, the same which distinguished Caesar himself. On libera-
lem v. n. on Marc. § 16.

magnanimum: AH magni animi: probably right as the adj.
occurs nowhere else in the speeches, though found in de Off. i. 63.
(Mr. Clark’s Anecd. p. xxxviii.)

ut volet quisque, accipiat, ‘ every one is free to take what I say
as he chooses.’ For the fut. (preS. required by Eng. idiom) Phil. ii.

ille quidem, n. on Marc. §9. The real antithesis, somewhat ξ 27,
veiled by the construction, is between regi-um nomen and opti-
mus pater familias cet.

agricola: confirmed by the statement in Varro (de re rust. i. 1. 10),
that Diophanes of Nicaea translated the six volumes of the Cartha-
giuian Mago, ⁶ the father of agricultural science,’ and sent them to
Deiotarus. Observe that D. is invested with the national virtues of the
old Roman: on the revived interest in agriculture at this time cp.
Sellar’s Vergil, pp. 186-188, and especially Cic. de senect. ἐξ 51-60.
