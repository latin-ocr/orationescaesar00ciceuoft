PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO.

cum . . cupiebas, indic. because the clause merely gives the
time of the action, not the circumstances or situation. So in Deiot.
ξ 3 nole: § 23, P.V. § 408 and nole.

cum . . voluisses : cp. n. on ξ 14, a conditional subj. : the clause
is equivalent to si . . voluisses ut lzos voluisti.

secessionem: cp. the historical ‘ secessions‘ of the plebs. The
converse view (to this passage) is to be found in pro Marcell. § 30:
there the orator is describing what the civil war was in fact, here
what it was in intention.

illam, gender fixed by the predicate word.

dignitas denotes ‘ rank ' reinforced by ‘ moral worth! The use
of the old English word ‘ worship ' ‘ worshipful ’ (worth-ship) illus-
trates it. (There was a preponderance of rank, he means, on the
Pompeian side.)

melior ε Lucan i. 128 victrix eausa deis placuit, sed victa Catoni.

communem causam, the cause of the (Pompeian) party.

pore.

which provinces were assigned to magistrates after their year of
office a Rome.

excusare. sc. se, ‘ to ask to be excused ' : unless=excusare morbum

Clark reads, after H, excusari: which Orelli had conjectured from
Phil. v. ξ 14]

ornnes necessitudines, ‘ close ties of every kind’: :omnium
generum : as in Sest. ξ 39, ib. ξ 55 omnium remediorum.

contubernales, ‘mess-mates' in the Social VVar Β. C. 89. In
Plane. ξ 100 this intimacy with L. Tubero is mentioned3 v. Dr.
Holden's note. Contuberm‘um (con-taberna) denotes the relation
(‘ tent-companionship ’) osa young Roman to the general officer in
whose train he served his apprentieeship in arms.

quidam: some one living, doubtless: Orelli suggests M. Mar-
cellus. Not Cato or Pompeius, who as dead might have been freely
mentioned.

etiamsi sentiret. R. 1532, RV. 243.

amplissimi viri, sc. Pompeii ε infra ξ 25-

si crimen est voluisse, ‘ if the mere wish is a ground of accusa-
