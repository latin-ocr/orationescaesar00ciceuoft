PRO REGE DEIOTARO ORATIO,

capita. caesorum in rostris proposita (cp. Flor. iv. 6. 5. on the
practice in time ofproseription)¹ ε ironical of course.

inquam generally used to emphasise the repetition of the same
word: here, of the same idea, that Caesar's victory alone has been
attended by no unnecessary bloodshed. Cp. Marcell. 5 28: and ’
my note on Cluent. ᾗ 65.

et, ‘ and after that‚' εἶτα ; used to dismiss a subject, with an im—
passioned question (Verg. A. i. 48), or indignant outburst (Mil. ξ 91).

nam both here and below gives the reason why the matter of the
statue has not been mentioned in the preceding sentence. But in
cffict it is a formula os ‘occupatio ἐ i. e. it anticipates an objection,
implying that there is nothing in it.

valde enim, ete.‚ ironical.

si loeus adfert invidiam: evading the real point, which was,
not that the statue was placed on the Capitol, but that it stood
among those of the Kings. ‘ If ever there was a King, Caesar was
one, though, like the greatest of our English kings‚ he never bore the
title) (W. W. Fowler‚ Caesar, p. 3652]

rostris: two statues os Caesar had been placed there, at the top
of the Forum Romanum.

plausu ε on the reception thus given to celebrities on their enter-
ing the theatre or circus, cp. Sest. ἐξ 115-118: ad Att. ii. 19. 3-—
‘populi sensus maxime theatro et spectaculis perspectus est' sq.:
Hor. C. ii. 17. 25 os the applause given to Maecenas aster his
illness.

nee . . et . .‚ lit. ‘ both not . . and ⁹: ‘ applause which, never ex-
pected in your case, has sometimes been sorgotten in the pure
ecstasy of your admirers.’ The stress always falls on the et-elause.
The reading in te (v. l. α ίί) rests on the testimony of AH. It
would have been an impertinence, in such a delicate matter, even to
refer to Caesar's personal feeling. ’

id . . aliquid, Lig. ξ 22 n.

quid amiserit: Introd. ᾧ 4.

multis, ‘to many‚’ sc. sociis victoriae tuae. The double dative
after the gerundive is an exception to the general rule (R. 1147,P.V.
† 361), to which, e. g. ‘ quibus est a vobis consulendum ’ (pro leg.
Man. ξ 6) confirms. Here however there can be no ambiguity. Cp.
R. vol. ii. p. lxxiv.

Antiochus Magnus, ‘ King of Asia ' from the Aegean to the
Indus, when Rome declared war against him B. C. 192: after his
defeat by L. Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus and his brother P. Scipio
Africanus at Magnesia B.C. 190, he was reduced to the rule of Syria.
