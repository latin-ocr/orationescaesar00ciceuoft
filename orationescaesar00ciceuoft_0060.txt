INTRODUCTJON.

in the reign of Tiberius, some time earlier than Asconius? The
gauntlet thus thrown down was soon taken up by critics conservative
in their various degrees. The first was Olaf VVorm, who published
an edition in the following year at Copenhagen, vindicating the
speech against &Volf's onslaught, while acknowledging the presence
in it of certain flaws of style and diction. &Veiske followed with a
yet more elaborate defenee¹3 which begins with an ironical proof
(by Wolf 's methods) that Wolf‘s edition itself is really the work of
a pseudo-Wolf. The quarrel of the critics is still sub iudice. Great
names have appeared on either side: sor Wolf, among others stand
Niebuhr, Orelli (who prints the pro Marcello at the end of the
rhetorical works)‚ and Kayser; on the conservative side, Drumann,
Teuffel, Hahn, Klotz, Richter, C. F. W. MUller, and the master-
critie Madvig.

ς 2. We can only give an outline of the evidence produced on
either side.

(a) The numerous citations in the ancient Grammarians are in
favour of the Ciceronian authorship of the pro Marcello. Though
Quintilian does not refer to it (any more than he does to the pro
Sulla or pro Sestio), it is cited by Nonius Marcellus, Arusianus
Messius, Servius, Lactantius, Priscian and others, none of them, it is
true, earlier than the third century Α. Ι). But the not unfrequent
form of quotation ‘ M. Tullius in Caesarianis'² implies a near re-
lationship of the Marcelliana to the two unquestioned speeches with
which we too associate it ³.

(b) We have earlier evidence in some parallels with Valerius
Maximus* and with the Panegyrics of C. Plinius Secundus ⁵; e. g. the
use of obstrepi in ξ 9 is imitated in Val. Max. viii. 15.'8; laterum
oppositus in ξ 32, Val. Max. iv. 7. 2 oppositus corporum ; ἐξ 11,
12 the contrast between Caesar's trophies and his enduring glory is
strikinssly imitated in Plin. Pan. lv. 9 arcus et statuas, aras etiam

³ The exact title is uncertain: the Grammarians quote it either
as ‘de M. Marcello ' or ‘pro M. Marcello' ; a slight piece of

{evidence for the view that the speech was not published in Cicero's
i etime.
