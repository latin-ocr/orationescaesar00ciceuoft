PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO.

naturally turned once more to Cicero for his advocacy; and its
effect upon the Dictator has been vividly described by Plutareh¹;
how at first he assumed an air of indifference to argument; but

how, as the orator proceeded, his colour came and went, and his Ι

agitation increased, till at the mention of the battle of Pharsalus
his excitement caused him to drop some papers which he was
holding. It was a splendid triumph of sheer eloquenee. Caesar
acquitted Ligarius, who shewed his gratitude only by joining the
conspiracy of Brutus and Cassius, and finally fell a victim to the
proscription os ΚΟ. 43.

Of the three ‘ Caesarian Speeehes ' the pro Ligario seems to us to
stand highest as a masterpiece of art. The orator begins by steering
clear of the reefs which might have wrecked his case ε by admitting
the charge and then with remorseless logie retorting it upon the
accuser himself. If Ligarius is guilty, Tubero is yet guiltier: not-
withstanding this, Tubero who has received a free pardon, would
fain have Ligarius punished with death. This gives Cicero an
opportunity both of pronouncing a spirited ‘apologia ‘ for the Pom-
peian party (Lig. ἐξ 17, 18), and os contrasting the clemency of
Caesar with the cruelty of Tubero. A historiari of Rome has well
remarked, ‘ Only a Cicero could have combined, under such trying
conditions, the dignity and independence os the republican with the
nicety and reserve of the courtier ².'

the claims of persecuted worth are higher than those of relationship.
In ξ 8 he exaggerates the neamess of the connexion. Probably L.
Tubero, father of the accuser, had married a Tullia.
