pletion os his Golden House, ⁸ se quasi hominem tandem habitare

coepisse’ (Suet. Ner. 31). In the same sentence, by a kind os

zeugma, poteratis is carried on to non . . . insectari in the sense

of debebatis ς’ you might havc' . . . ‘ you ought not to have‚‘ etc.).
esto, εἶεν, ‘ granted you ought.' adeone concedi debet?

abducere domum, srom the embassy of Deiot. τ v. ξ 2.

omnibus familiis: Castor had violated not merely the tie of
blood (non uni propinquo, sc. Deiotaro) bnt the ties which
united the household‚ slaves as well as children, under the pater-
familias.

a tanta auctoritate, ‘ by such a high authority': ‘res pro per·
sona,' hence the preposition. Cp Ovid‚ saepe sequens agnam lupus
est a voce retentus‘ by the tuneful bard)

o tempora, o mores = ‘how times have changed ¹' (Familiar to ᾧ 31.

Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, tribune Β. c. 104, to revenge himself
on M. Aemilius Scaurus for not having nominated him an augur,
indicted him in the comitia tributa (in iudicium populi vocavisset)
for curtailing the rites of the Penates; the acensed was acquitted by
a narrow majority.

principem civitatis, ‘the leading citizen of the time’: as Cic.
says of Pompeius, ‘cum in republica Cn. Pompeius princeps esset’
(ad Fam. i. 9. 11). This significant, though unofficial title, was taken
by the Caesars as the best designation of their position. It is not to
be identified with the title princeps senatus, ‘ first on the senatorial
roll ’ as made out by the censors: a title which this M. Scaurus also
held: cp. de orat. ii. ξ 197 p. et senatus et civitatis, which corn-
bines both.

death of his daughter.

iura. et. exempla, ‘law and precedent’: of the latter ξ 31 gives
an example. domestica=vestrae domus.

inquiam-es, ‘ sully’ or ‘ contaminate': the word is connected
with caenum, ‘mud.’

eius. .nomine. ‘he used the name of that excellent man ξ 33.
when he wished to abuse you?
