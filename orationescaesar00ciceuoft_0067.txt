NOTEs: CHAP. J. ξ 1—JJ. ξ 4.

idem, masc. ‘at the same time’3 qualifies the subject of two
contrasted predicates(fine1n attulit, initium attulit). So § 11 huius

' nutem rei tu idem es et dux et comes.

tantum . . . modum, ‘ such entire moderatiori in the most exalted
station': lit. ‘so great moderation in all things in tlte case os the
highest official power.’ Cp. Deiot. ξ 1 in tuo periculo: and infra
§3 in multis. Also the phrase sine modo et modestia ‘without
limit or restraint.'

sapientiam paene divinam, ‘almost superhuman wisdom ἐ
attributed again to Caesar, §5 8, 19 infra, and Deiot. ξ 4. It refers
to that mastery over the passions (especially revenge) which should
characterise the philosopher: v. Lig. § 38.

auctoritatem, here almost ‘ vote‚' the expression of one's ‘ moral ξ 2.
support.’

nec mihi persuadere . . distracto z ⁶ and 1 could not bring myself
to regard it as possible or lawful for me to occupy my former field of
work, aster my partner and comrade had been torn from my side,
the man who had emulated and imitated my studies and pursuits.’
The infin. is justified by the latter of the governing verbs: but for a
Ciceronian ex. of infin. aster suadeo v. R. 1345.

interclusam, ‘ closed against me‚’ keeps up the metaphor of a
‘course ’ (curriculum) which had to be cleared. In signum .. .
sustulisti there is a change to a military metaphor. A red or white
flag (properly vexillum), hung out from the general's tent, was the
signal for marehing out to battle, or to the founding of a colony;
for the former cp. Liv. xxii. 45 Varro nihil consulto collega signum
proposuit, sor the latter Cic. Phil. ii. ξ 102 Casilinum coloniam
deduxisti, ut vexillum tolleres. ”

mihi, dative of the person ‘ eoncemed in the action,’ or the (so- ξ 3.
called) dat. of the agent: sor the limits of its use v. R. 1146, K.
222, P. V. 138.

concessisti, ‘yielded Marcellus to the prayers of the Senate':
cp. the use of condono, as non sibi ac defensioni suae condonatum
esse Oppianicum (Cluent. 109), ‘had not been pardoned out of con-
sideration for himself.'

iudicio tuo gravissumo et maxumo, ⁴ your strongly-expressed
and significant verdict.' The simple adjectives magnus, summus,
tantus, often require a more definite rendering in English: magnum
crimen, ‘ a serious charge)

merito, an adverb. ξ 4.

aut ullo laudis genere, ‘ or in any other praiseworthy quality.’

nullius, classical gen. of uem0; cp. the abl. nullo ξ, 13 (R. 372
