Marcellus of our Speech was a lifelong friend of Cicero's, as several
letters testify3 although by some twelve years his junior, attached to
him by political sympathies and common pursuits. In Brut. ξ 249
the highest praise is awarded to his oratory, which he had exercised
more than once in the defenee of optimates, as of T. Annius Milo
accused B.C. 56 de vi by P. Clodius, In B.C. 51 he was consul with
Ser. Sulpicius Rufus and played a leading part in the diplomatic
struggle between Caesar and the Senate‚ which served for little
but to define the issues of the deadly war that followed. We are
here only concerned with the action in it of Marcellus. Caesar’s
ten years of Gallie command ended properly on March 1, B.C. 49 :
he could not enter on the consulship he desired until Jan. 1, B.C. 48.
It was his object to ensure himself against impeachment by retaining
his command for those intervening ten months ³. Marcellus accord-

superseded in Gaul on March 1 of B.C. 49 : a proposal which Pom-
peius ultimately supported. Stin, the actual naming of Caesar's
successors (in his two provincesN being deferred to B.C. 50, M. had
embittered Caesar against himself to no purpose. NVorse than this,
he inflicted a gross personal affront upon him, by seourging in Rome

attitude is less militant and more respectful. He had begun to
take the measure of his adversary. When the tribune Curio ap-
peared on Jan. 1, 49 with Caesar's ultimatum, he proposed, though
in vain, that the Senate should suspend its judgment until the
